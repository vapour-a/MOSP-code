MOSP-code is a Python-based project inspired by Minecraft 1.20.1. The original source code has been rewritten in Python to serve as a foundation for building a custom game or experimenting with Minecraft-inspired mechanics.
The project is still experimental and under active development, with ongoing improvements being made in the fork MOSP-LinerX. This repository is 
intended as a base for developers to explore, modify, and expand upon, and it is released under the MIT License.
NOTE: The project currently only supports Linux.
